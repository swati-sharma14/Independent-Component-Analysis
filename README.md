# 📶 Separating Mixed Signals using ICA (Independent Component Analysis) 

This program implements ICA from scratch to separate mixed signals. The steps involved are as follows:

🔸 Generate a sinusoidal wave and a ramp wave and plot them. <br>
🔸 Use the following mixing matrix 🎚️: <br>
   [[0.5, 1] <br>
   [1, 0.5]]

   to mix the signals. Plot the mixed signals. <br>
🔸 Now use ICA to recover the original signals and plot them. <br>

## Usage 🚀

1. Run the program to execute the steps mentioned above.
2. The generated and mixed signals will be plotted for visualization.
3. The recovered signals will also be plotted after applying ICA.
